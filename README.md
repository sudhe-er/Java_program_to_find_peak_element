# Java_program_to_find_peak_element
An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists). Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements. Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Possible Answer: 2
Generated Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.
